    Learns Bayes Network from an ordered set of targets and observed features.

    Description:
    Given a variable ordering of targets and observations, the goal is to learn
    a joint probability of targets and the variables which relate to them via
    Bayes Network. Consider the following dataset:

    +--------+--------+--------+-----+-------+----+
    | Person | Test_1 | Test_2 | EKG | ANGIO | VR |
    +--------+--------+--------+-----+-------+----+
    |   p1   |   0    |    1   |  1  |   1   |  1 |
    +--------+--------+--------+-----+-------+----+
    |   p2   |   1    |    1   |  1  |   1   |  0 |
    +--------+--------+--------+-----+-------+----+

    Test_1 and Test_2 are tests done on them at a certain point in time.
    EKG, ANGIO, and VR are procedures they received later in life.

    P(E, A, V, T) ~= P(E | T) P(A | E, T) P(V | E, A, T)

    Based on Algorithm 1 in "Discriminative Boosted Bayes Networks for Learn-
    ing Multiple Cardiovascular Procedures", but makes an assumption that
    T specifies both the elements and their ordering (i.e. instead of specif-
    ying both T and O variables, the ordering set in O is assumed to be the
    the same as it would be in T).
